            <p>My passion was always to learn something. I was never afraid to
                step outside of my comfort zone. I have a Bachelor Degree in Journalism. After
                moving to the United States, I have decided to learn something new and undiscovered.
                Time past, and after many years of learning something new and unexpected, I ended
                up collecting Certificates in Paralegal and 3D Animation. 
                I fell in love with Animation. Itâ€™s an amazing world of moving, dancing and developing 
                characters for a different type of creatures. I have been working as an animator for a 
                couple of years, and after a while, I have decided to learn a new skill, in addition to my animation skills.
                I went into coding. And here I am now, learning something foreign, very hard and yet interesting.

              <p>I have a very adventurous family. Every day after work we spend outdoors to get as much sunlight as we can. 
                Go to parks, or for a little 10K run. Working out is a major part of our lives. 
                When we do not work - we travel! We explore the National Parks in the states.
                We travel to Europe or Asia, to learn about the history of those countries, meet new people 
                and taste a huge variety of delicious food. The world is very big and interesting.
